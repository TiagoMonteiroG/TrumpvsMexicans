This game was created by a group of five.
It was a project that we had to create for the Java Bootcamp we were part of.
We only had been learning Java for 3 weeks when the game started to get developed.
The deadline for the project was 1 week.
All the time that was given to the project was on our free time after the "working schedule of the Bootcamp".
All of the people involved in the project had no previous knowledge of Java or programming before this bootcamp.
